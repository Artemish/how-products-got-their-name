# How Products Got Their Name
> Sometimes it's kind of interesting to know the origins of the products/projects we love. Here's a list of such products/projects and the details of how they got their name

### MySQL (Database management system)

[Michael "Monty" Widenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius) is one of the founder of MySQL and one of his daughter's name is My(after whom MySQL was named).

### Git (Version control system)

Linus Torvalds (Developer of Git) has quipped about the name git, which is British English slang for a stupid or unpleasant person. Torvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'.The man page describes git as "the stupid content tracker".

### Ubuntu (Operation system)

The OS was named after the Southern African philosophy of [ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)) (literally, 'human-ness'), which Canonical Ltd. suggests can be loosely translated as "humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".

### Java (Programming language) 

The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside James Gosling(Developer of Java)'s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from [Java coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_coffee).

### Python (Programming language) 

In [Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)(Developer of Python)'s own words:

_"In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."_

### Ruby (Programming language) 

The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Yukihiro Matsumoto(DEveloper of Ruby) and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.[15] Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.

### Scala (Programming language) 

The name Scala is a portmanteau of scalable and language, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.

### Django (Python frmaework)

The framework was named after guitarist [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt).

### Chrome (Browser)

An answer from Glen Murphy, Design Lead, Google Chrome on asking "How Chrome gets its name?". In his words,

_"We had a ‘pick a codename’ vote early in the development cycle – the names that came of that competition were so terrible that we were all pretty happy when one of the leads overrode it and declared that the codename would be ‘Chrome’, presumably because he likes fast cars."_

### Mozilla (Company)

The history of the name Mozilla goes all the way back to the internal codename for the original 1994 Netscape Navigator browser, with the name meaning "Mosaic killer" and aiming to some similarity with the building-crushing [Godzilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla), as the company's goal was to displace [NCSA Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) as the world's number one web browser. The name Mozilla was revived as the 1998 open sourcing spinoff organization from Netscape.

### Firefox (Browser)

The name "Firefox" (a reference to the [red panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda)) was chosen by Mozilla for its similarity to "Firebird" (which was the former name of Firefox), but also for its uniqueness in the computing industry.

### Laravel (PHP Framework)

_"When trying to think of names, I thought about the geography of Tolkien's Middle Earth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia. In Narnia, Cair Paravel is the name of the castle where the kings and queens of Narnia live. Laravel rhymes with Paravel. I thought the name had a classy and sophisticated ring to it."_ — [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) (Creator of Laravel)
