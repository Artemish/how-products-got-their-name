# How Products Got Their Name
> List of products/projects and the description of how they got their name

## MySQL

- [Michael "Monty" Widenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius) is one of the founder of MySQL and one of his daughter's name is My(after whom MySQL was named).

## Python

- In [Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)(Developer of Python)'s own words:

_"In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."_

## Ruby

- The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Yukihiro Matsumoto(DEveloper of Ruby) and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.[15] Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" â€“ it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.
